Hi, I'm Muqeem Ahmed — a graduate student in Computer & Information Systems with a strong passion for AI, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Interfaces.

🔍 My work focuses on building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between human language and technical systems. Most recently, I worked on a project that uses LangChain, Meta’s LLaMA models, and SQL to enable text-to-SQL query generation, allowing users to interact with databases using simple English.

🧠 I enjoy exploring:

Large Language Models (LLMs)

LangChain framework for LLM orchestration

SQL + Natural Language Interfaces

Prompt engineering & model optimization

Cloud-based AI deployment

🚀 Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge in LLM fine-tuning and exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for better contextual response systems.# text_sql
