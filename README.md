🔍 About This Project
This final-year project explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the LangChain framework to simplify database querying through natural language.

Title: Text-to-SQL Query Generation using LangChain and LLMs

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between non-technical users and structured databases. Instead of writing SQL queries, users can simply ask questions in everyday English—like “Show me all orders over $3000”—and the system will generate, execute, and return the results of a valid SQL query.

🚀 Key Features:

Natural language to SQL conversion

Meta’s LLaMA model integration

LangChain-powered orchestration

SQLite database querying

Optional SQL agent support for enhanced logic

This project demonstrates how generative AI can transform user interactions with databases by making data retrieval intuitive, accessible, and intelligent.
